# Payment Processing Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the payment processing implementation for CognitechX Academy's checkout system. The system uses Stripe for secure payment processing and integrates with our backend for transaction recording.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe Elements & Stripe.js
- **Authentication**: Clerk
- **State Management**: RTK Query
- **UI Notifications**: Sonner Toast

## Implementation Details

### 1. Component Structure
```
payment/
├── index.tsx          # Main payment component
├── StripeProvider.tsx # Stripe context provider
└── README.md         # This documentation
```

### 2. Payment Flow

#### 2.1 Initialization
1. Component mounts and initializes Stripe Elements
2. Loads user data from Clerk
3. Retrieves course information from current context

#### 2.2 Payment Form
1. Renders Stripe Elements payment form
2. Displays course preview and order summary
3. Shows payment method options (currently Credit/Debit Card)

#### 2.3 Payment Processing
1. User submits payment form
2. Frontend validates form data
3. Constructs base URL for redirect:
   - Local development: `http://${NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCAL_URL}`
   - Production: `https://${NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL}`

#### 2.4 Stripe Integration
1. Calls `stripe.confirmPayment()` with:
   - Payment Elements instance
   - Return URL for redirect
   - Redirect mode set to "if_required"

#### 2.5 Transaction Recording
1. On successful payment:
   - Creates transaction record with:
     - Transaction ID from Stripe
     - User ID from Clerk
     - Course ID
     - Payment amount
     - Payment provider ("stripe")
2. Saves transaction to database via API

#### 2.6 Post-Payment Flow
1. Shows success message
2. Waits 3 seconds
3. Redirects to `/user/courses`

### 3. Error Handling

#### 3.1 Pre-payment Errors
- Stripe not initialized
- Missing base URL configuration
- Invalid form data

#### 3.2 Payment Errors
- Failed payment confirmation
- Network errors
- Invalid card details

#### 3.3 Post-payment Errors
- Transaction creation failure
- Redirect errors

### 4. Security Considerations
1. All sensitive payment data handled by Stripe Elements
2. No credit card information stored on our servers
3. Secure HTTPS connections required
4. User authentication required for checkout

### 5. Environment Variables
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_LOCAL_URL=localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL=your-production-url.vercel.app
```

### 6. User Experience
1. Real-time form validation
2. Clear error messages
3. Loading states during processing
4. Success confirmation before redirect
5. Automatic redirect to courses page

### 7. Testing
To test the payment integration:
1. Use Stripe test cards (e.g., 4242 4242 4242 4242)
2. Verify transaction creation
3. Check redirect functionality
4. Test error scenarios

### 8. Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: React.Children.only Error
**Solution**: Implemented direct success message rendering instead of complex component transitions

#### Issue: Navigation Timing
**Solution**: Added 3-second delay before redirect to ensure user sees confirmation

#### Issue: Transaction Recording
**Solution**: Added error handling for failed transaction creation while still acknowledging successful payment

## Maintenance Notes
- Keep Stripe.js version updated
- Monitor transaction creation success rate
- Review error logs for payment failures
- Update test cards as needed
- Maintain security compliance
